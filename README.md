# CS331 Naive Bayes' Net

### Description

This project was in collaboration with classmate Garrett Whitehurst.

This program uses the Naive Bayes' Inference algorithm to look at a set of reviews that were in a text file and try to predict whether it was a good or bad review based on the words.

We were supplied with both the training set and test set text file. The training set was used to build up a knowledge base of words and what review type those words were accociated with. The review types were indicated with a 1 for good and a 0 for bad in the text file.
Once the knowledge base was built up, we run the algorithm on the test set and training set. The output of the program will the state the accuracy with which it predicted the reviews of both text files.
